# VexBrainSimulator
This is a program created to help students in the Vex Robotics program. It is a python package that can simulate the vex brain, controller, motors, pneumatics, and even bumpers! It runs off of pygame, and by editing three lines (usually) of your code, you can download it right onto your robot!
